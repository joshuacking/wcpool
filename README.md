World Cup Pool
Intended for use as a Lambda function. Manages a World Cup Pool (or really, any team-based pool) wherein each participant drafts a number of teams and gets points for each team win or tie.

For example, in the prototype World Cup scenario, we'd have 8 participants. Each participant would draft 4 teams (countries), typically done in "snake order". Participants accumulate points for each match result. The participant with the most points at the end of the tournament/season wins.
